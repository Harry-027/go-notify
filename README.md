* Run the command `make setup` (this will start the required docker containers - postgres, redis, apache kafka & zoo-keeper).
* Run the command `docker ps` to ensure all the four containers are up & running.
* Open a new terminal & run the command `make server` to spin up the api server.
* Open a new terminal & run the command `make consumer` to spin up the kafka consumer.
* Open a new terminal & run the command `make cronjob` to start the cron processes.

* Run the command `make monitor` to start Api-server monitoring.
* Once the containers - Prometheus & Grafana are up, visit http://localhost:3000 on browser for Grafana dashboard.
* Default credentials for Grafana: username - 'admin' , password - 'admin'
